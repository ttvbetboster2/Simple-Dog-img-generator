# Random Dog Image Generator.

This is a little React project I built to get more experience with using APIs, React hooks, animations, and responsive layout styling
The app shows you a random dog image every time you load the page or press the button. The images come from the awesome [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/), which provides free access to dog pictures from different breeds.

##  Built With

- **React** – functional components with `useState` and `useEffect`
- **JavaScript** – used for logic and fetching the API
- **CSS** – all layout, transitions, and animations
- **Dog CEO API** – [https://dog.ceo/dog-api](https://dog.ceo/dog-api)

## Credits

Big thanks to the [Dog CEO API team](https://dog.ceo/) for making this API free and open to use. This project wouldn’t be possible without it.
